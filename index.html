  <p>Today in computer science class we learned how to use 
     a Relay in ESP32.<br> ESP32 is a powerful 
     microcontrpoller that can do anything you want, like 
     control domotic, make a little robot, an alarm... 
     <br> Principally we make that a light bulb goes on 
     with an push-button. The relay is a semicvonductor 
     that can make pass the energy or not. Also we made a 
     code to have a message in a OLED screen to see when 
     the relay is on. To make the code we used <em>Arduino 
     Blocks</em> that is a platform to program with 
     arduino IDE with blocks intead of code. <br>I really 
     enjoyed that class, and I hope to learn more about 
     ESP32 and computer science in the future.

  <p>Today in computer science class we learned about 
     HTML, what is and how to use it.<br> HTML is the way 
     to make web sites, is a code composed of tags that 
     tell the browser how to display the content. An 
     example of HTML is this web site, I'm programing this 
     web site with this type of code.<br> I really like 
     programing, so I'm going to specialise in programing 
     in the future, I think that computer science is my 
     perfect work.<br> In this image we can se a part of 
     the code of this web site.
